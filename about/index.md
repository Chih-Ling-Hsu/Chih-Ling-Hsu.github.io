Chih-Ling Hsu is a `data science enthusiast` who loves to learn and build new things.   She reflects a varied personality including genuineness, dependability and the qualities of rationality and thoughtfulness.   Determined to fight for what she desires, Chih-Ling believes that nothing great comes easy and with efforts everything is possible.

<!--### My family and My Early Life

When Chih-Ling was young, her father, who is a professor of mechanical engineering, taught her to see things objectively and tackle complicated issues by decomposing it into simple parts.   She has been encouraged to learn the nature of the world not only by scientific books and literature works but also by personal experiences through traveling.   As the eldest daughter in the family, Chih-Ling is expected to set a fine example for her sister and her brother.   This experience made her a broad-minded person and also a leader in study groups throughout her high school life and college life.

Despite her reading hobby, Chih-Ling is also interested in art and music.   She joined pop music club in high school and played the electronic guitar in several public performance events.   Specifically, Chih-Ling loves `rock music` and considers playing music as a way to express and release her emotions.   During her high school life, she was also trained for patience and perceptivity through sketches assignments and fountain pen writings.   In her last year in high school, she imitated Pierre-Auguste Renoir’s `oil painting`, “Young Girls at the Piano”, and exhibit it along with the imitations painted by other students in National Experimental High School.-->

### My Training & Working Background

When studying in college, Chih-Ling found herself talented in computer programming and passed Computer Programming Examination of National Tsing Hua University during her freshman year.   In Chih-Ling’s sophomore year, she received `Academic Excellence Award`, affirming her academic ability in Computer Science.   She also learned about activity planning and how to host an event when participating in the Student Association.

In the last semester in college, Chih-Ling worked as a long-term intern in `LITE-ON Technology Corporation`.   In the 6 months she worked in LITE-ON, she cooperated with auto testing team in Beijing and built several auto testing tools for the newly developed firmware of multi-functional printer.   In 2017, she worked as a part-time employee at `National Center for High-Performance Computing (NCHC)`, where she fostered her capability of exploratory data analytics under the supervision of a senior statistician.   She also contributed to the foundation of a big data analysis platform at NCHC by building machine learning tools using Apache Spark with Java programming language.

Chih-Ling is now a full-time student, motivated by the hunger after knowledge as she strives to accumulate not only her technological know-how but also her ability to work out any problems she encounters.   She is currently completing the Master Degree Program in `Institute of Computer Science and Engineering` at National Chiao Tung University.

### Sports & Interests

Talking about sports, Chih-Ling is absolutely not good at it ever since she was in the elementary school.   She can’t even hit the volleyball ten times in a row.   Actually, she has a history of asthma, which is cured owing to her persistence on `swimming`.   Chih-Ling can now swim all 4 swimming strokes.    She even ranked the eleventh in Hsinchu City Backstroke Swimming Competition at her ninth.

Apart from swimming, Chih-Ling also embraces a fanatical interest in `skiing`.    She has been to several ski resorts in Japan and Korea to enjoy the wonderful struggle between speed and control.    The magnificent mountain view is also one of the incentives.   In fact, in her several `backpack trips` to Europe, hiking is always in itinerary due to the same reason.   Nature is the gift of God, and humans can never stop admiring its breathtaking beauty.

One of Chih-Ling’s favorite city is `Budapest`.   With the Danube flowing through the heart of Budapest, the Hungarian capital is divided into Buda, the old town area, and Pest, the downtown area packed with museums and galleries.   The rainy view at its riverside is the scene Chih-Ling appreciates the most.   She and her friends took several pictures there, with their umbrellas throwing to the ground carelessly.
