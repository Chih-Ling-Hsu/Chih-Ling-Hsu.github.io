$G(n, p)$, the Erdos-Renyi Random Graph, defines a family of graphs, each of which starts with $n$ isolated nodes, and we place an edge between each distinct node pair with probability $p$.
In $G(n, p)$ Model, the probability of obtaining any one particular random graph with $m$ edges is $p^{m}(1-p)^{N-m}$ with the notation $N=\binom{n}{2}$
As a result, $G(n, p)$ defines a bigger familiy than $G(n, m)$ since $n$ and $p$ do not uniquely determine the graph so number of possible graphs are larger.

## Phase Transition for the Largest Connected Component

The network undergoes "phase transition" for the size of laregest connected component for the model $G(n, p)$, where the average degree $\bar{k} = 1$ is a sharp threshold for connectivity:

- When the average degree $\bar{k} = p(n-1) <1$, **the fraction of nodes in its largest connected component is close to $0$**.
- When the average degree $\bar{k} > 1$, the fraction of nodes in its largest connected component grows larger as the average degree $\bar{k}$ grows larger
That is, **the probability of a giant component goes to 1**, and all other components will have size at most $\log(n)$.

For random graphs, threshold phenomena like the figure above are very common.
Nudging the value of $\bar{k}$ slightly around the critical value of $1$ causes drastically different behavior in the limit, so it is called a sharp threshold.
Similarly, any monotone property also exhibits this threshold phenomena in Erdos-Renyi Model with respect to $p$.

To check the simulation of largest connected component size versus average degree, [this website](http://netlogoweb.org/launch#http://netlogoweb.org/assets/modelslib/Sample%20Models/Networks/Giant%20Component.nlogo) is very helpful.



## Degree Distribution of Erdos-Renyi

Erdos-Renyi Model has a **binomial distribution** over degree $k$.
That is, let $P(k)$ denotes the fraction of nodes with degree $k$, we have

$$
P(k)={n-1 \choose k}p^{k}(1-p)^{n-1-k}
$$

- **Average degree**: $\bar{k} = p(n-1)$
- **Degree variance**: $\sigma^2 = p(1-p)(n-1)$

which is a binomial distribution which has a peak at $\bar{k}$ and a variance of $\sigma^2$.


So how big is the degree variance in relation to the average degree?
From the calculation below, we can see that the degree variance is about $(n-1)^{-1/2}$ times of average degree.

$$
\frac{\sigma}{\bar{k}} = \bigg(\frac{1-p}{p} \frac{1}{n-1}\bigg)^{1/2} \approx \frac{1}{(n-1)^{1/2}}
$$

By the law of large numbers, as the network size increases, the distribution becomes increasingly narrow, and we are increasingly confident that the degree of a node is in the vicinity of $k$.
As a result, we can assume that for very large $n$ and fixed $p$ each node ends up with almost the same degree.

## Erdos-Renyi has almost No Clustering

Since edges in $G(n, p)$ appears individually independently with probability $p$, for any node $v$ its [local clustering coefficient](../../../2020/05/12/Graph#clustering-coefficient) is

$$
C(v) = \frac{e(v)}{\frac{1}{2}k(v) \big(k(v) - 1\big)} = \frac{p \times \frac{1}{2}k(v) \big(k(v) - 1\big)}{\frac{1}{2}k(v) \big(k(v) - 1\big)} = p = \frac{\bar{k}}{n-1} \approx \frac{\bar{k}}{n}
$$

And the clustering coeffient for a random graph $G(n, p)$ becomes

$$
\tilde{C}(G) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{v \in N} C(v) = p = \frac{\bar{k}}{n-1} \approx \frac{\bar{k}}{n}
$$

Clustering coefficient of a random graph is small.
For very large graphs with fixed degree ($\bar{k}$ is a fixed constant) the clustering coefficient goes to zero.
In other words, if we generate bigger and bigger graphs with fixed average degree $\bar{k}$ (by setting $p = \frac{\bar{k}}{n-1}$), then $\tilde{C}(G)$ decreases with the graph size $n$.

## Path Lengths of Erdos-Renyi

Given a Erdos-Renyi model with degree $\bar{k}$, we re-contruct this graph into a tree and start from the root node, then we can reach

- $1+\bar{k}$ nodes in the 1st step
- $1+\bar{k}+\bar{k}^2$ nodes in the 2nd step
- ...
- $1+\bar{k}+\bar{k}^2+...+\bar{k}^h \approx \bar{k}^h$ nodes in the $h^{th}$ step

Based on the fact that Erdos-Renyi random graph has few triangles and local clusters, most of the nodes are hit on the last step.
Therefore, $\bar{k}^h \approx n$ and the diameter (the average shortest path) of Erdos-Renyi becomes

$$
h \approx \log _{\bar{k}}(n) = \frac{\log(n)}{\log(\bar{k})} = \frac{\log(n)}{\log\big(p(n-1)\big)}
$$



On the other hand, it is noteworthy that, the average shortes path converges as the number of nodes ($n$) increases, given a fixed average degree $\bar{k} = n \cdot p = \text{ constant}$.

## Comparison with Real-World Network

Here we compare Erdos-Renyi Random Graph with [MSN Network](../../../2020/05/15/network-example) and check if the real-world network, MSN Network, conforms with the Erdos-Renyi Model.

| | Connectivity | Degree distribution | Clustering coefficient | Diameter |
| - | - | - | - | - |
| MSN Network | Giant Largest Connected Component (99% of nodes are in the largest connected component) | Heavily right skewed power-law distribution<br>Average degree $\bar{k} = 14.4$ | $0.11$ | $6.6$ |
| Erdos-Renyi Model $G(n=180 \text{ million}, p)$ | Giant Largest Connected Component exists since $\bar{k} \approx 14 > 1$ | Binomial distribution | $\tilde{C}(G) = \frac{\bar{k}}{n-1} = \\ \frac{14.4}{180M} \approx 8 \times 10^{-8}$ | $h = \log(n)\\ \approx 8.2$ |
| Explainable? | Yes | No | No | Yes |

Unlike Erdos-Renyi Random Graph, a real-world social networks exists lots of "triadic closure" (friend of a friend is also my friend), resulting in high clustering.
In particular, Erdos-Renyi graphs do not have two important properties observed in many real-world networks:

1. They do not generate **local clustering** and triadic closures
2. They do not account for **the formation of hubs**. (The degree distribution of ER graphs converges to a Poisson distribution, rather than a power law observed in many real-world, scale-free networks)

The Watts-Strogatz model addressed the first limitation while the Barabasi-Albert Model and the Configuration Model addressed the second one.
