In this document, we will walk through the data exploration of [Airline on-time performance dataset](http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/) with [Apache Pig](https://pig.apache.org/) as our exploring tool.   We will analyze **8 years** of flight data to answer the following 3 analytic questions.

1. Find the maximal delays (you should consider both ArrDelay and DepDelay) for each month of 2008.
2. How many flights were delayed caused by weather between 2000 ~ 2005? Please show the counting for each year.
3. List Top 5 airports which occur delays most in 2007. (Please show the IATA airport code)

## I. Analytic Tool

`Apache Pig` is a platform for analyzing large data sets that consists of a high-level language for expressing data analysis programs, coupled with infrastructure for evaluating these programs. The salient property of Pig programs is that their structure is amenable to substantial parallelization, which in turns enables them to handle very large data sets.

Here are some useful websites:

- [Apache Pig Official Website](https://pig.apache.org/)
- [Apache Pig Tutorials Point](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/apache_pig/index.htm)

Simply saying, the data model of `Pig Latin` is fully nested and it allows complex non-atomic datatypes such as **map** and **tuple**.

- A **field** is a piece of data.
- A **tuple** is a record formed by an ordered set of fields, which can be of any type.
    - A tuple is similar to a row in a table of RDBMS.
    - Example − `(Raja, 30)`
- A **bag** is an unordered set of tuples. In other words, a collection of tuples (non-unique) is known as a bag. Each tuple can have any number of fields (flexible schema).
    - A bag is similar to a table in RDBMS, but it is not necessary that every tuple contain the same schema.
    - Example − `{(Raja, 30), (Mohammad, 45)}`
- A **map** (or data map) is a set of key-value pairs. The key needs to be of type chararray and should be unique. The value might be of any type.
    - Example − `[name#Raja, age#30]`

Note that a **Relation** is the outermost structure of the Pig Latin data model, which is also a **bag** where **inner bags** are allowed.   Except `LOAD` and `STORE`, while performing all other operations, Pig Latin statements take a relation as input and produce another relation as output.

## II. Dataset

[Airline on-time performance dataset](http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/) consists of flight arrival and departure details for all commercial flights within the USA, from October 1987 to April 2008. This is a large dataset: there are nearly **120 million records** in total, and takes up **1.6 gigabytes of space** compressed and 12 gigabytes when uncompressed. 


### A. Supplement Data

If you need further information, the [supplement data](http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/supplemental-data.html) describes the locations of US airports, listing of carrier codes, information about individual planes, and meteorological data.


### B. Flight Data

The Schema of the flight data is as follows

- Year int,
- Month int,
- DayofMonth int,
- DayOfWeek int,
- DepTime  int,
- CRSDepTime int,
- ArrTime int,
- CRSArrTime int,
- UniqueCarrier varchar(5),
- FlightNum int,
- TailNum varchar(8),
- ActualElapsedTime int,
- CRSElapsedTime int,
- AirTime int,
- ArrDelay int,
- DepDelay int,
- Origin varchar(3),
- Dest varchar(3),
- Distance int,
- TaxiIn int,
- TaxiOut int,
- Cancelled int,
- CancellationCode varchar(1),
- Diverted varchar(1),
- CarrierDelay int,
- WeatherDelay int,
- NASDelay int,
- SecurityDelay int,
- LateAircraftDelay int

Here the flight dataset from `2000` to `2008` is downloaded to the directory `data/` using the shell command `wget`.


```sh
%sh

mkdir data
for i in 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2007 2008
do
  wget -nv -O data/$i.csv.bz2 http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/$i.csv.bz2
done
```

## III. Analytic Problems

To solve the analytic problems, first we **load the data** from `2000` to `2008`.

```pig
%pig

dataset_raw = LOAD 'data/{2000,2001,2002,2003,2004,2005,2007,2008}.csv.bz2' 
    USING PigStorage(',') AS (Year:chararray, Month:chararray, DayofMonth:chararray, 
    DayOfWeek:chararray, DepTime:chararray, CRSDepTime:chararray, ArrTime:chararray, 
    CRSArrTime:chararray, UniqueCarrier:chararray, FlightNum:chararray, 
    TailNum:chararray, ActualElapsedTime:chararray, CRSElapsedTime:chararray, 
    AirTime:chararray, ArrDelay:int, DepDelay:int, Origin:chararray, Dest:chararray, 
    Distance:chararray, TaxiIn:chararray, TaxiOut:chararray, Cancelled:chararray, 
    CancellationCode:chararray, Diverted:chararray, CarrierDelay:chararray, 
    WeatherDelay:int, NASDelay:chararray, SecurityDelay:chararray, 
    LateAircraftDelay:chararray); 
```
```
dataset = FILTER dataset_raw BY Year != 'Year';

tmp = LIMIT dataset 2;
DUMP tmp;
```

```
(2000,1,28,5,1647,1647,1906,1859,HP,154,N808AW,259,252,233,7,0,ATL,PHX,1587,15,11,0,NA,0,NA,,NA,NA,NA)
(2000,1,29,6,1648,1647,1939,1859,HP,154,N653AW,291,252,239,40,1,ATL,PHX,1587,5,47,0,NA,0,NA,,NA,NA,NA)
```



### Q1. Find the maximal delays (you should consider both `ArrDelay` and `DepDelay`) for each month of `2008`. 

From the dataset that consists of flight records from `2000` to `2008`, I extract records of `2008` and group these records acoording to the `month` of the flight.   For each group, we sort the departure delays and the arrival delays and then pick the top ones to show.

```pig
%pig

data_2008 = FILTER dataset BY Year == '2008';
records = FOREACH data_2008 GENERATE Month, ArrDelay, DepDelay,
            (ArrDelay + DepDelay) AS SumDelay;
grpd = GROUP records BY Month;

top_delays = FOREACH grpd {
 arr_delays = ORDER records BY ArrDelay DESC;
 dep_delays = ORDER records BY DepDelay DESC;
 sum_delays = ORDER records BY SumDelay DESC;
 arr_delays_top1 = LIMIT arr_delays 1;
 dep_delays_top1 = LIMIT dep_delays 1;
 sum_delays_top1 = LIMIT sum_delays 1;
 GENERATE group AS Month, FLATTEN(arr_delays_top1.ArrDelay) AS ArrDelay, 
          FLATTEN(dep_delays_top1.DepDelay) AS DepDelay,
          FLATTEN(sum_delays_top1.SumDelay) AS SumDelay; 
};

DUMP top_delays;
```

```

```




The query result is stored into the folder `q1`.

```pig
%pig

STORE top_delays INTO 'q1';
```




So that we can read the query result and visualize the top delays for each month.

```python
%python

import glob, os 
import pandas as pd

# Read file

all_rec = glob.iglob(os.path.join("q1", "part*"), recursive=True)    
dataframes = [pd.read_csv(f, sep="\t", header=None) for f in all_rec]
df = pd.concat(dataframes, ignore_index=True)
df.columns = ['Month','Top Arrival Delay', 'Top Departure Delay', 'Top (Arrival Delay + Departure Delay)']

# Convert minutes to hours
for col in df.columns:
    if col == 'Month':
        continue
    df[col] = [float(x)/60 for x in df[col]]
df
```

```



```python
%python

ax = df.plot(x='Month', y=['Top Arrival Delay', 'Top Departure Delay', 
                            'Top (Arrival Delay + Departure Delay)'], 
             kind="line", style="-o", figsize=(15,5))
ax.set_title("The Maximal Delays for Each Month in 2008")
ax.set_ylabel('hour(s)')
```

```

From the table and the figure shown above, we can see that in 2008,

1. the **largest arrival delay** happens in `February` and `April`, which are also when the **largest departure delay** occurs.
2. the **smallest arrival delay** and the **smallest departure delay** both occur in `November`.
3. the maximal delays in summer and autumn is smaller than the maximal delays in winter and spring.

### Q2. How many flights were delayed caused by weather between `2000 ~ 2005`? Please show the counting for each year.

To answer this question, I retreive flight records needed and group them by the `Year` of the flights.   For each group, I count the number of flight records whose `WeatherDealy` is more than 0 minute(s) and show the calculation results.

```pig
%pig
data_q2 = FILTER dataset BY (Year != '2008') AND (Year != '2007');
records = FOREACH data_q2 GENERATE Year, WeatherDelay;
grpd = GROUP records BY Year;
q2 = FOREACH grpd {
    weather_delays = FILTER records BY WeatherDelay > 0;
    GENERATE group, COUNT(weather_delays); 
};

DUMP q2;
```

```
(2000,0)
(2001,0)
(2002,0)
(2003,44620)
(2004,115989)
(2005,111388)
```




The query result is stored into the folder `q2`.

```pig
%pig

STORE q2 INTO 'q2';
```




So that we can read the query result and visualize the count of weather delays for each year.

```python
%python

import glob, os 
import pandas as pd

# Read file
all_rec = glob.iglob(os.path.join("q2", "part*"), recursive=True)    
dataframes = [pd.read_csv(f, sep="\t", header=None) for f in all_rec]
df = pd.concat(dataframes, ignore_index=True)
df.columns = ['Year','Weather Delay']

df
```

```
   Year  Weather Delay
0  2000              0
1  2001              0
2  2002              0
3  2003          44620
4  2004         115989
5  2005         111388
```



```python
%python

ax = df.plot(x='Year', y='Weather Delay', kind="line", style="-o", figsize=(15,5))
ax.set_title("The Count of Weather Delay for Each Year")
ax.set_ylabel('Count')
```

```
<matplotlib.text.Text object at 0x11a972ac8>
```

![](https://i.imgur.com/w9oDPX9.png)


From the table and the figure above, we can find that

1. There are no weather delays from `2000` to `2002` in flight records.   However, I think this may due to the missing of the data or the fact that they did not record if a dealy flight is caused by weather before `2003`.
2. There are more weather delays in `2004` than that in `2003`, which may be partially driven by the increase in the total number of flights.
3. Unexpectedly, the count of weather delays in `2005` is less than that in `2004`.

### Q3. List Top 5 airports which occur delays most in `2007`. (Please show the `IATA` airport code)

In the following operation on `pig` dataset, I first retreive only the flight data in `2007`, and then group the delay flights by their departure airport to **count the frequency of occuring departure delay for each airport**.

```pig
%pig

data_q3 = FILTER dataset BY (Year == '2007') AND (DepDelay > 0);
records = FOREACH data_q3 GENERATE Origin, DepDelay;
grpd = GROUP records BY Origin;
counts = FOREACH grpd GENERATE group AS Airport, 
                               COUNT(records) AS DelayCount;
sorted = ORDER counts BY DelayCount DESC;
q3_1 = LIMIT sorted 5;

DUMP q3_1;
```

```
(ATL,206118)
(ORD,183984)
(DFW,135433)
(DEN,109839)
(PHX,105917)
```



```pig
%pig

data_q3 = FILTER dataset BY (Year == '2007') AND (ArrDelay > 0);
records = FOREACH data_q3 GENERATE Origin, ArrDelay;
grpd = GROUP records BY Origin;
counts = FOREACH grpd GENERATE group AS Airport, 
                               COUNT(records) AS DelayCount;
sorted = ORDER counts BY DelayCount DESC;
q3_2 = LIMIT sorted 5;

DUMP q3_2;
```

```
(ATL,209826)
(ORD,188410)
(DFW,148059)
(DEN,122557)
(LAX,113379)
```




The query result is stored into the folder `q3`.

```pig
%pig

STORE q3_1 INTO 'q3/dep';
STORE q3_2 INTO 'q3/arr';
```




So that we can read the query result and visualize the top airports that occur departure/arrival delays the most.

```python
%python

import glob, os 
import pandas as pd

# Read file
rec_dep = glob.iglob(os.path.join("q3", "dep", "part*"), recursive=True)    
rec_arr = glob.iglob(os.path.join("q3", "arr", "part*"), recursive=True)    
df_dep = pd.concat([pd.read_csv(f, sep="\t", header=None) for f in rec_dep], 
                ignore_index=True)
df_arr = pd.concat([pd.read_csv(f, sep="\t", header=None) for f in rec_arr], 
                ignore_index=True)
df_dep.columns = ['Airport', 'Departure Delay']
df_arr.columns = ['Airport', 'Arrival Delay']

The top 4 airports that occurs delay the most times are the same for departure delay and arrival delay, which are

1. `ATL` - William B Hartsfield-Atlanta Intl Airport in **Atlanta**
2. `ORD` - Chicago O'Hare International Airport in **Chicago**
3. `DFW` - Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport in **Dallas-Fort Worth**
4. `DEN` - Denver Intl Airport in **Denver**

However, the 5th highest departure delay count occurs at

5. `PHX` - Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport in **Phoenix**

while the 5th highest arrival delay count occurs at

5. `LAX` - Los Angeles International in **Los Angeles**
