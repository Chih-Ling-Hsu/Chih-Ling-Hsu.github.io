The data reflecting our real world can be represented in networks sometimes.   With network data, we can ask questions such as

- What are the Patterns and statistical properties of network data?   Why networks are the way they are? Can we find the underlying rules that build these networks?
- Can we model the networks?   Can we predict behavior? Why/How things go viral?
- How does the network structure evolve over time?

To answer the questions, we need to understand network properties (e.g., diameter, scale-free / power law network, small-world behavior), network models that fit our observations (e.g., Erdos Renyi random graphs, Kleinberg’s model models, ... etc), and algorithms that could unflod on our netoworks (e.g., page rank, decentralized search, label propagation, link prediction, community detection, ... etc).

On the other hand, in order to solve the questions, the graph representation of a real system should be properly designed.   
The way nodes and links are assigned determines the type of questions we can study
For example, for a social network, we can either set "Nodes=people, Edge=if they are friends" or "Nodes=people, Edge=if they follow each other" to answer different questions.


## Basic Definitions

A graph is a way of specifying relationships among a collection of items.
Usually, we use the notation $G = (N, E)$ to represent a graph, where

- $N$ is a set of objects called **nodes** (vertices)
- $E$ is a set of **edges** (links) that connectes pairs of nodes

In the rest of this page, we are going to use the notation $G = (N, E)$ consistently, and we suppose we have $\|N\| = n$ nodes and $\|E\| = m$ edges in our graph $G$.
Some other graph definitions are also listed as below
- **neighbors**: two nodes are neighbors if they are connected by an edge
- **directed graph**: In a directed graph, edges have orientation
- **weighted graph**: In a weighted graph, every edge has an associated weight with it

Other graph definitions like node degrees,  bipartite graphs, and graph isomorphism are introduced below.

### Node Degrees

In general, the degree of a node $x$ is defined as

$$
k(x) = \text{the number of edges adjacent to node } x
$$

And the average degree can be formulated as

$$
\bar{k} = \langle k\rangle = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{x \in N} k(x) = \frac{2\|E\|}{\|N\|}
$$

In directed networks, we calculate in-degree $k^{in}(x)$ and out-degree $k^{out}(x)$ separately.   


### Bipartite Graphs

Bipartite graph (or bigraph) is a graph whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets $U$ and $V$ and such that every edge connects a node in $U$ to one in $V$.

Similarly, there are also Tri-partite graph, k-partite graph, and so on.

### Graph Isomorphism

Graphs $G$ and $H$ are isomorphic in the situation that "any two nodes $u$ and $v$ of $G$ are adjacent in $G$ **if and only if** $f(u)$ and $f(v)$ are adjacent in $H$".

If an isomorphism exists between two graphs $G$ and $H$, then it can be denoted as $G \simeq H$.

## Graph Representations

To represent a graph or a network, we can use an adjacenct matrix, an edge list, or an adjacency list.

**1. Adjacency Matrix**

$$
\begin{equation}
  A_{ij}=\left\{
  \begin{array}{@{}ll@{}}
    1, & \text{if there is a link from node } i \text{ to node } j \\
    0, & \text{otherwise}
  \end{array}\right.
\end{equation} 
$$

**2. Edge List**

An edge list is a list of tuples, each contains a pair of nodes that are connected by an edge.

```
(2, 3)
(2, 4)
(3, 2)
(3, 4)
(4, 5)
(5, 2)
(5, 1)
```

**3. Adjacency List**

An adjacency list is a list that lists out the neighbors of each node.

```
1:
2: 3, 4
3: 2, 4
4: 5
5: 1, 2
```

## All About Edges

In a graph, an edge can possess attributes such as

- Weight (e.g., frequency of communication)
- Ranking (e.g., best friend, second best friend)
- Type (e.g., friend, relative, co-worker)
- Sign (e.g., Friend vs. Foe, Trust vs. Distrust)

In addition, with edges we can analyze paths, distances, diameter, cycles, and connectivity of a graph.

### Paths

A path in a graph is a sequence of nodes such that each consecutive pair in the sequence is connected by an edge.

Here are some definitions related to paths:

- **Simple Path**: In a simple path nodes do not repeat
- **Edge Betweenness**: number of the shortest paths that go through an edge in a graph
    - In the Girvan-Newman Method, clusters can be discovered by successively deleting edges of high edge betweennes

### Distance

Distance (shortest path) between a pair of nodes is defined as the number of edges along the shortest path of the pair of nodes.
In directed graphs, paths are required to follow the direction of the arrows, and thus distance isnot symmetric.
Algirithms such as Breadth-First Search (BFS) can be used to search for shortest path between a node and all other nodes.


### Diameter

Graph diameter can be measured as the **largest shortest path**.
However, there may exist an outlier in the distribution of shortest paths.
To deal with ourliers, we can also measure graph diameter with the **average of shortest paths** among all nodes.
As an example, the average shortest path length for a strongly connected graph can be calculated as $\bar{h} = \frac{1}{2\|E\|} \sum_{i, j\neq i}h_{ij}$ where $h_{ij}$ is the distance from node $i$ to node $j$.



### Cycles

A cycle is a closed path with at least three edges, while all nodes should be distinct except the first and the last

### Connectivity

A graph is **connected** if for every pair of nodes there is a path between them.
Relatively, a graph is **disconnected** if it is made of at least two connected sub-graphs (components).

Furthermore, a directed graph is **strongly connected** if for every pair of nodes there is a path between them.
On the other hand, a directed graph is **weakly connected** if there is a path between every two vertices in the underlying undirected graph (if we disregard edge directions).

Some other definitions related to connectivity are listed below:

- **Connected component**: A connected component of a graph is a subset of the nodes such that (1) every node in the subset has a path to every other and (2) the subset is not connected to any additional node in the supergraph.
- **Local bridge**: $\overline{AB}$ edge is a local bridge if $A$ and $B$ have no neighbors in common, but there exist another path from $A$ to $B$.
- **Embeddedness of the edge**: the number of common neighbors shared by the two endpoints (e.g., Bridges have embeddedness of zero)
- **Neighborhood overlap of the edge**: Neighborhood overlap of the edge $\overline{AB}$ is defined as $\frac{\text{Embeddedness of }\overline{AB}}{N(A) \cup N(B) - A - B}$ where $N(x)$ represents the neighbors of $x$




## All About Nodes

One big question we often ask graph data is: "Which vertices are important?"
Intuitively, we would consider a "star" (the central node that connects a lot of other nodes) as an obviously important case and also consider nodes in a "circle" are equivalently important.
In general, we can use cantrality measures to rank the nodes in a graph.
There are many [centrality measures](../../../2020/05/14/Centrality) and page rank is currently the most prominent approach that deals with directed graphs.


### Node Ranking Evaluation

With centralitry measures described in [another document](../../../2020/05/14/Centrality), we can sort all the nodes and rank them for each metric (betweeness, closeness, degree, ...).
If we want to compare two ranks, we can use **Kendall tau rank**, which is a statistic used to measure the ordinal association between two measured quantities.

As shown in the formula below, Kendall tau rank counts pairwise agreements and disagreements between two ranking lists.
Perfect agreement happens at $\tau=1$ and complete disagreement happens at $\tau=-1$

$$
\tau = \frac{n_c - n_d}{n(n-1)/2}
$$

- $n_c$: number of concordant pairs
- $n_d$: number of discordant pairs

For example, for two ranks shown in the table below, each with 5 nodes A, B, C, D, and E, the pair $(A, B)$ is a concordant pair and the pair $(C, D)$ is a discordant pair.

| | Ranking List 1 | Ranking List 2 |
| - | - | - |
| ranked 1st | A | D
| ranked 2nd | B | C
| ranked 3rd | C | A
| ranked 4th | D | B
| ranked 5th | E | E


### Clustering Coefficient

In graph theory, a clustering coefficient is a measure of **the degree to which nodes in a graph tend to cluster together**.
The global version of clustering coefficient was designed to give an overall indication of the clustering in the network, whereas the local clustering coefficient gives an indication of the **embeddedness of single nodes**.


More specifically, **local clustering coefficient** of a node $v$ is given by calculating "what is the fraction of your neighbors are neighbors themselves?"

$$
C(v) = \frac{e(v)}{\frac{1}{2}deg(v) \big(deg(v) - 1\big)}
$$

- $e(v)$ denotes the links between the neighbors of $v$
- $deg(v) = k(v)$ is the node degree of $v$

![](https://imgur.com/7FTJYsM.png)

Additionally, the **network average clustering coefficient** of a graph $G = (N, E)$ is given by

$$
\tilde{C}(G) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{v \in N} C(v)
$$

And we can claim that a graph $G$ is **clustered** if 

$$
\tilde{C}(G) \gg p = \frac{\|E\|}{\frac{1}{2} n (n-1)}
$$

where $p$ can be interpreted as edge density, the probability that two nodes are connected in a random graph.

For example, if we are given a graph illustrated in below,

![](https://imgur.com/xsr5XbX.png)

the local clustering coefficient of any arbitrary node $v$ is

$$
C(v) = \frac{3}{\frac{1}{2}\times 4 \big(4 - 1\big)} = 0.5
$$

and thus by comparing it with a random graph, this graph $G$ may be called a clustered graph since

$$
C(G) = \frac{1}{12} \times (12 \times 0.5) = 0.5
\\
p = \frac{24}{\frac{1}{2} \times 12 (12-1)} = \frac{4}{11} \approx 0.36
$$

$$
\Rightarrow C(G) > p
$$
