## Method

We introduce a method for developing an interactive system, named EmailPro, which gives writing suggestions that are likely to contain patterns that fit well with the context of an unfinished sentence.
It prevent you from common grammar mistakes and help you adopt collocations correctly and frequently.
The method involves preprocessing Enron Email Dataset, apply Skip-Gram Model to generate collocation candidates, generate lexical bundles through N-Gram filtration, analyze lexical bundles to obtain patterns, and build a statistical prediction model that ranks patterns and offers writing suggestions.
